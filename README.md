# Gender Bias on Wikipedia

This repository contains the results and presentation of my 1-week final project for my Data Analytics bootcamp at Spiced.

## Purpose
This project provides a gender-related visual analysis of an existing dataset containing 2.29 million records of notable individuals on Wikipedia. It demonstrates the gender gap in the biographies on the platform, in terms of articles that exist about male, female and notable people identifying with "other" genders.

Results include the distribution of articles across genders in general, by time of living, and geographically by their citizenship. They also show a ranking of the most notable people on Wikipedia based on the Notability Index calculated by the authors of the dataset, dividing rankings by the individuals' broad occupation (the index indicates visibility on Wikipedia based on Wikipedia-specific variables, see "Measuring notability" [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01369-4#Sec2)).

You can also find some reasons why gender bias exists on Wikipedia and how this impacts its content.

## Why Wikipedia? 
Wikipedia consists of entirely human-generated content and can serve as one example for the existing gender bias on the internet, possibly even mirror gender bias in society to a certain extent.
